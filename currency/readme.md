This is a standalone service that provides currency exchange rates for different currencies. The service implements a gRPC server and uses protobuf for data exchange.
### To test the service, run "go install github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl/cmd/grpcurl" to install "grpccurl" which is a command line tool to interact with gRPC APIs.
 
### gRPC 
 Google Remote Procedure Call, more commonly known as gRPC, is a remote procedure call (RPC) framework that brings performance benefits and modern
 features to client-server applications. Like RPC, it allows you to directly call methods on other machines. It is fast, efficient, and secure, and allows you to generate code quickly.
 
 
### Protobufs
 Protocol Buffers is a free and open-source cross-platform data format used to serialize structured data. It is useful in developing programs to communicate with each other over
 a network or for storing data.
